*Intermittent 504s and slow responses*

Requests were taking a long time to be satisfied, sometimes timing out with a 504 generated by my [CDN provider](https://bunny.net/).

The issue appears to have been communication issues within the 3rd party CDN provider - disabling their "Origin Shield" functionality resolved the issue (suggesting comms issues between their edge and upper tier).

The issue resolved itself before it could be better investigated and the provider was unable to establish root cause.
