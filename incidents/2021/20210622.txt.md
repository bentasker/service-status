An [incident](https://status.bunnycdn.com/incidents/qbvwvmx82mnv) at my [CDN provider](https://twitter.com/BunnyCDN) affecting their DNS resolution services interrupted resolution of names served by that CDN.

The result is that, for some users, my services were unreachable.

Although the provider reported resolution within 10 minutes, issues were still experienced for a while after.
