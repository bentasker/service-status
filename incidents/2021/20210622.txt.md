An [incident](https://status.bunnycdn.com/incidents/qbvwvmx82mnv) at my [CDN provider](https://twitter.com/BunnyCDN) affecting their DNS resolution services interrupted resolution of names served by that CDN.

The result is that, for some users, some of my services are unreachable.

Although the provider reported resolution within 10 minutes, issues were still experienced for a while after.


### 11:28 UTC

Despite [assurances by the provider](https://twitter.com/BunnyCDN/status/1407266033627394048) issues continue to be experienced, with service intermittently available (uptimerobot also reports the service as down).

Comments by other users suggests that the issue is still widespread - Bunny's nameservers periodically fail to resolve names.
