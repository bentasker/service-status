### Details
*502 errors*

For a short period of time, bentasker.co.uk and some other services were returning 502 errors.

This is an occurrence that has happened too regularly in recent months, however it has previously always resolved itself before I was able to investigate in depth:

* [2021-09-05](incidents/2021/20210905.txt.md) - Interruption to BunnyCDN hosted assets
* [2021-07-29](incidents/2021/20210729.txt.md) - Interruption to BunnyCDN hosted assets
* [2021-07-28](incidents/2021/20210728.txt.md) - Interruption to BunnyCDN hosted assets

Today, the cause has been identified as an issue around BunnyCDN's Paris origin shield tier (whether routing within the CDN, or from the Shield to my Origin). This morning's issue resolved immediately once the shield was disabled.

Services not served via BunnyCDN remained unaffected.
