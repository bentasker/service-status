### Details
*502 errors*

For a short period of time, bentasker.co.uk and some other services were returning 502 errors.

Investigation suggests that these errors were generated within the CDN - BunnyCDN - fronting the services.

IP level routing to my infra doesn't appear to have been affected, and all services remained available, suggesting the 502s relate to issues routing betwwen BunnyCDNs tiers.

Duration of interruption was 4 minutes 58s, ending at13:50 UTC today
