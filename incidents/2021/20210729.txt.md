*50x errors*

For a short period of time, bentasker.co.uk and some other services were returning 500 and 502 errors.

Investigation suggests that these errors were generated within the CDN - BunnyCDN - fronting the services.

IP level routing to my infra doesn't appear to have been affected, and all services remained available, suggesting the 502s relate to issues routing betwwen BunnyCDNs tiers.

Dyration of interruption was 4 minutes 27s, ending at 11:33 UTC today
