BenTasker.co.uk Service Status Record
========================================

I previously operated a seperate Service-Status log, however, having [change my CDN approach](https://www.bentasker.co.uk/blog/privacy/730-updated-privacy-policy) that prior approach doesn't really work.

This repo is used to detail incidents affecting service - the most recent incidents will be linked to from this README, but older reports can be found within the directory heirachy
